# Car Price Prediction with EDA

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for car price prediction, along with exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset. The notebook explores a dataset of car features and uses machine learning algorithms to predict the price of a car based on its characteristics.

## Kaggle Notebook

You can find the notebook used for car price prediction and EDA on Kaggle by following this link: [Car Price Prediction Notebook on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gamalragab/eda-car-price-prediction-with-97-accuracy)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook contains various attributes of cars, such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, etc. It is used to train and evaluate machine learning models to predict the price of a car. The dataset is included in the repository as 'car_data.csv'.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook includes the following sections:

1. Data Exploration and Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to gain insights into the car features, their distributions, correlations, and relationships with the price. The EDA section provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, identifies any outliers or missing values, and helps in feature selection for the prediction model.

2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features that have the most impact on predicting car prices.

4. Model Building: Training and evaluating various machine learning models, such as linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, for car price prediction.

5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

6. Conclusion: Summarizing the findings, discussing the accuracy achieved in predicting car prices, and providing insights from the EDA analysis.

## Usage

To run the notebook locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone [<repository_url>](https://github.com/gamalragab21/car-price-eda-prediction)

2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Open the notebook file, 'car_price_prediction.ipynb', using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Execute the cells in sequential order to reproduce the exploratory data analysis and predictions.

Feel free to explore the notebook, dive into the EDA section, and experiment with different models or techniques to further improve the accuracy of car price prediction.
